   * Number of time to retry after rate limit response (default 1)
   */
  rateLimitRetryAttempts: 1
  /**
   * Concurrency calls to riot (default infinity)
   * Concurrency per method (example: summoner api, match api, etc)
   */
  concurrency: undefined,
  /**
   * Riot games api key
   */
  key: '',

# Run all examples

Download code from git and:

## Simple
```$ RIOT_API_KEY={YOUR_KEY} yarn example```

## Specific examples
```$ RIOT_API_KEY={YOUR_KEY} yarn example {exampleFunctionName}```

## With docker
Edit docker-compose.yml with your api key and:
```$ docker-compose up```

## Real project
We did a project based on a "twisted" package, this project is not finished but it is a very good example<br />
Github: https://github.com/twisted-gg

# Options

The following environment variables can be set either in the ```.env``` file or as shown in the examples:
 
## ```RIOT_API_KEY```

Obtained from the Riot Games developer page(https://developer.riotgames.com/)
Necessary to use this library.

## ```UPDATE_CHAMPION_IDS```

This library has an option to fetch an actual version of champion IDs regularly. This is useful in case a new champion
gets added, while the application runs. E.g. data crawlers, or services which aren't supposed to be restarted regularly.

Set the value to ```true``` or ```1``` to enable this feature.
